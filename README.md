I'm a passionate and versatile developer who loves creating responsive, high-quality websites and web apps that look great and just work.

I focus on building pixel-perfect, user-friendly interfaces with a strong eye for design and performance. Whether it‚Äôs a sleek marketing site or a full-scale application, I enjoy bringing ideas to life with clean, modern code.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech I work with day-to-day:
‚Ä¢ Frontend: HTML, SCSS, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript/ JavaScript, Alpine.js
‚Ä¢ Frameworks: Angular (currently working with Angular 18), and a bit of React Native on the side
‚Ä¢ Backend: PHP, Laravel
‚Ä¢ CMS: Statamic (using Laravel under the hood), and Custom WordPress when needed

I'm confident working across the full stack, but frontend is where I thrive‚Äîespecially when I can combine creativity with technical problem-solving.

üöÄ Outside of work, I‚Äôm always building and learning. I enjoy exploring new tech, working on side projects, and sharpening my skills to stay current.
