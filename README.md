# 💫 About Me:
<br>Hi 👋🏻, Im Ben, I’m a front end developer specialising in designing and building exceptional digital experiences.<br><br>I'm a coding bootcamp graduate that currently works for Kayo Digital as a Project Support Developer. Prior to working at Kayo Digital I attended Le Wagon, a coding bootcamp in London. This is where I learned how to build full stack applications from the ground up. During my time at the bootcamp I fell in love with the process of designing and building visually appealing user interfaces. In my role at Kayo Digital, I'm responsible for assisting our clients with issues and supporting the wider production team with wire framing, designs and building digital products. I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest web technologies, trends, techniques and strive to design and build applications that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional.
